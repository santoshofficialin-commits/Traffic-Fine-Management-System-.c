# Traffic-Fine-Management-System-.c


A rule-based traffic fine calculation engine written in C, designed to
demonstrate clean control-flow logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
statements.

This project simulates real-world traffic rule enforcement by calculating
penalties based on vehicle speed, safety compliance, and license validity.
